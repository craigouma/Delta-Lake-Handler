# Delta Lake Handler

This is the implementation of the Delta Lake handler for MindsDB.

## Delta Lake

Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark and big data workloads.

## Implementation

This handler uses the Delta Lake library to connect to a Delta Lake instance, enabling integration with Delta Lake tables in MindsDB.

## Usage

To establish a connection to a Delta Lake table in MindsDB, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE delta_lake_db
WITH ENGINE = "deltalake",
PARAMETERS = {
   "delta_table_path": "/path/to/delta/lake/table"
}
```

The delta_table_path parameter specifies the path to the Delta Lake table.

You can insert data into a Delta Lake table as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE delta_lake_db.test_table
AS
SELECT *
FROM some_source;
```

You can query a Delta Lake table within MindsDB as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM delta_lake_db.test_table;
Filtering by conditions:
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM delta_lake_db.test_table
WHERE column_name = 'value';
```

This Delta Lake handler provides seamless integration with your Delta Lake data within MindsDB, allowing you to leverage Delta Lake's capabilities in machine learning and predictive analytics.


Please replace `/path/to/delta/lake/table`, `delta_lake_db`, `test_table`, and other placeholders with your actual configuration and use case details.
